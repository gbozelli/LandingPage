# Landing Page
Well, at this point the things are really challenger! Make a entire page isn´t a difficult task, but requires a lot of research and patience, which is fundamental for software engineers.
## HTML/CSS
HTML byself isn´t hard. With CSS, it becomes a pain. A double pain. I literally drew on a paper the entire site before moving on code, because its very simple write the pieces of HTML with a visual concept and add the CSS with the HTML as a basis. Don´t write the CSS code if you don´t know what to do, just for "complete the HTML". First, have a solid concept of what really do. 
## Flexbox
The initial demand is to make a site with FlexBox and basics boxes commands, like `padding` or `margin`, using 4 main contents. As a begginer in HTML/CSS, it´s not easy to implement this, because, if you are starting at CSS, visualizing the "boxes" around the contents is very hard, and understand FlexBox concepts like `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink` took me, at least, two hours and dozens of tries. But, it´s here!
## Conclusion
The best thing to make if you want to learn something is applying the knowledge that you required. Initially, it´s not easy, but is very rewarding. The "Odin Project", actually, teaches me a lot, and i just started it!
